                                I practiced building interactive websites as a self-taught learner, following a few books as my guide. 
                                I am definitely still a beginner and find myself struggling a lot.
                                Watching past BMC projects has been incredibly inspiring, as I have seen so many amazing works produced by the end of this course. 
                                I am excited about the opportunity to create interactive content.
                                <br>
                                <br>I have a broad interest in building AR/VR experiences, especially since my initial MRP proposal was AR project. 
                                Although it evolved into making an interactive web app, I would love to use this opportunity to create AR/VR content. ">

                                I practiced building interactive websites as a self-taught learner, following a few books as my guide. 
                                I am definitely still a beginner and find myself struggling a lot.
                                Watching past BMC projects has been incredibly inspiring, as I have seen so many amazing works produced by the end of this course. 
                                I am excited about the opportunity to create interactive content.
                                <br>
                                <br>I have a broad interest in building AR/VR experiences, especially since my initial MRP proposal was AR project. 
                                Although it evolved into making an interactive web app, I would love to use this opportunity to create AR/VR content. ">

                                <br>- Differences: While linear media follows a narrative structure, mostly adhering
                                <br> to chronological or logical order, non-linear media focuses on planning each scene 
                                <br>from the user journey perspective.

                                    <br>and instead, you can manipulate the RectTransform to move the image.
                                    <br> 2. OnDrag: This method gets called during the drag operation. 
                                    <br> The PointerEventData provides information about the touch or pointer position, 
                                    <br>and you can use it to update the position of the object being dragged.
                                    <br> 3. OnEndDrag: This method is called when the user finishes dragging (releases the touch or pointer).

                                    One of our teammate shared 2D animation file as .mov format. However, Unity does not support .mov format, 
                                    and should be coverted to mp4. However, mp4 format does not have alpha property, 
                                    <br> so it cannot export animation with transparent background. I learned the 2D animation should be 
                                    <br> prepared as png sequences on the sprite sheet. So I can convert the sprite sheet and slice them in Unity.

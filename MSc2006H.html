                                I practiced building interactive websites as a self-taught learner, following a few books as my guide. 
                                I am definitely still a beginner and find myself struggling a lot.
                                Watching past BMC projects has been incredibly inspiring, as I have seen so many amazing works produced by the end of this course. 
                                I am excited about the opportunity to create interactive content.
                                <br>
                                <br>I have a broad interest in building AR/VR experiences, especially since my initial MRP proposal was AR project. 
                                Although it evolved into making an interactive web app, I would love to use this opportunity to create AR/VR content. ">

                                <br>- Differences: While linear media follows a narrative structure, mostly adhering
                                <br> to chronological or logical order, non-linear media focuses on planning each scene 
                                <br>from the user journey perspective.

    - The [**XR Origin (AR Rig)**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/xr-origin.html) represents the device in space. When the user moves or rotates in the real world, the XR Origin (AR Rig) moves accordingly in the Unity scene. And just like your real device has a camera, the XR Origin (AR Rig) has a **Camera** GameObject attached to it.
        - The **Camera** (a child of XR Origin (AR Rig)) is the main camera of the AR application and must be set with the **MainCamera** tag. It comes with additional components that allow this camera to work for AR, which you can read about in the [Tracked Pose Driver](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.legacyinputhelpers@2.1/manual/index.html#tracked-pose-driver), [AR Camera Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.1/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARCameraManager.html), and [AR Camera Background](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARCameraBackground.html) documentation. It is recommended that you delete any other cameras in the scene to avoid conflicts.
    - The [**AR Session**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.2/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARSession.html) manages an individual session of the AR experience, including things like **frame rate and communication** with the device. There can only be **one active AR Session in a scene.**

                                <br>
                                The training modules designed around a practical decision-making approach will guide users 
                                in understanding the rationale behind selecting appropriate parameters for each indication, 
                                promoting safe and effective NMES applications. With an interactive platform, the tool enhances 
                                visual comprehension by allowing users to observe the real-time effects of electrode placement 
                                and parameter adjustments, as well as explore motor points on 3D anatomical models. 
                                It also offers guidance on monitoring unresponsive patients, building users' confidence to make adjustments 
                                based on muscle movement observations rather than solely on patient feedback. 
                                Ultimately, we aim for this tool to support broader integration of NMES as a reliable, 
                                valuable rehabilitative method for ICU-AW patients.">
